NLP-based Multi-Class Text Classification System (Fake / Hate / Safe)

• Designed and implemented an end-to-end NLP pipeline to classify news titles into fake, hate, and safe categories.
• Processed and trained on 175K+ text samples with class imbalance handling using SMOTE.
• Implemented and compared multiple text representations including Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and GloVe embeddings.
• Evaluated classical ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, XGBoost) and deep learning models (LSTM, Bi-LSTM).
• Achieved 75% overall accuracy and balanced macro F1-score using GloVe embeddings with Logistic Regression.
• Built modular, reusable ML pipelines with Scikit-learn and TensorFlow/Keras.
• Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Gensim, NLP, Pandas, NumPy.
